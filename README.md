# Boolean Calculator – Compiler Project

## Description
This is a compiler coursework project that implements a Boolean expression calculator
using **Lex (Flex)** and **Yacc (Bison)**.

The project demonstrates lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation of Boolean expressions
based on defined grammar rules.

## Files
- `boolcalc.l` – Lex file for tokenizing input
- `boolcalc.y` – Yacc file defining grammar and evaluation rules

## Concepts Covered
- Lexical Analysis
- Syntax Parsing
- Compiler Design Basics
- Grammar Rules
- Boolean Expression Evaluation

## Tools / Technologies
- Lex (Flex)
- Yacc (Bison)
- C Programming

## Notes
This project was completed as part of a university compilers module.
